Hello <%= "#{@person.first_name} #{@person.last_name}" %> ,

Thank you for your support at last year's Queen's Park Auction. As you may remember, we had implemented a more efficient way of bidding and to mitigate potential mistakes by asking everyone to register for a Bidder Number. To save time, you can reuse your bidding number from last year. See you at the auction.

Your bidder number is <%= @person.id %>.

YOU MUST RSVP to this event if you do not have regular Queen's Park access. Please email pressgalleryauction@gmail.com. 

=== Auction Rules ===

1. All bids must be made using your bidder number.
2. You will be called or emailed by the end of the week if you were a winning bidder.
