Hello <%= "#{@person.first_name} #{@person.last_name}" %> ,

At last year’s Queen's Park Auction you registered and received a BIDDING NUMBER! This code allowed you to easily and repeatedly bid on items without having to write too much, and was easier for us to read so no mistakes were made.

Your bidder number is <%= @person.id %>.

=== Auction Rules ===

1. All bids must be made using your bidder number.
2. You will be called or emailed by the end of the week if you were a winning bidder.
3. Payment is by cash or cheque. We do not accept credit cards. Please bring the exact amount owed or make personal cheques payable to the Ontario Legislative Press Gallery.
4. Items must be picked up in Room 475 of the Legislature and paid for by 5 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 7 or they will be offered to the next highest bidder.
5. We do not deliver.
6. We do not gift wrap.
7. Please bear in mind when you come to pick up an item, reporters may be busy writing on deadline so please try to pick up earlier in the day if possible.
